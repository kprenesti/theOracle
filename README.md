#The Oracle

This started as a Free Code Camp assignment that I took the initiative to build into a somewhat larger project.  The original project simply wanted us to make a Wikipedia Viewer, which would require the use of Wikipedia's API and some basic HTML, CSS, and possibly Bootstrap.  I wanted to learn Angular and Gulp, and I wanted to ramp up my project-making skills, so I created this project, which not only returns search results from Wikipedia, but it also returns results from Google, and a dictionary.

## Skills Used in This Project
- Angular.js
- HTTP requests
- JSON handling
- Gulp
- JavaScript / jQuery
- SASS / CSS
