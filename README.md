#The Oracle

This is a [FreeCodeCamp assignment](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) that demands the use of the Wikipedia APIs to create a Wikipedia search results viewer.  I elaborated on the project by creating it in Angular so that I could learn how to use Angular's features.

## Skills Used in This Project
- Angular.js
